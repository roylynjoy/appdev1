1. AI- Generated Content

Artificial Intelligence are continuously improving as other technology evolves, It is one of the most fastest technology that has the power to change our lifestyle or even our environment. These kind of technology impacts both the educational and IT industry from creating educational materials, generating articles, and developing marketing campaigns to composing music and producing realistic visuals(Nikita Duggal).

The main purpose of this is to help the human speed up the writing process and make it more easy to produce such content.

A lot of universities and such institutions considered AI as an educational tool for them to create and help them identify the legitimacy of such content. These tool also impacts the IT industry by bringing the easier way to produce such content or work.

Examples:
smart assistants
social media monitoring
personalized learning
Automated grading
content creation

2. Synthetic Media 

Synthetic media are contents that is entirely generated by AI, this includes deepfakes, virtual influencers, and automated video content.  

The main purpose of this technology is to help the users build their own content and make advance videos using AI.

This challenge both educational sector and IT industry in bringing the most advance output that is somehow unreliable and prone to attackers

3. Blockchain Technology

This provides security and decentralize way of recording and verifying transactions and data. The main goal is to increase transparency, reduce fraud, and create immutable records.

It is used to issue and verify academic credentials, certificates, and transcripts securely and supports secure sharing educational content for academic purposes. While in IT industry, this is used in cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, supply chain management etc.

Examples:
Learning Machine’s blockchain credentials, MIT’s Digital Diploma.
Bitcoin and Ethereum, IBM’s Food Trust blockchain for supply chain, Hyperledger Fabric for enterprise solutions.

4. Internet of Things

Internet of Things allows the physical computers to connect to the internet for it to collect, share, and act on data. Its purpose is to create smarter environments by enabling real-time monitoring, automation, and decision-making.

For its usage, IoT is used in smart classrooms, where connected devices control lighting, temperature, and security. It also supports remote learning by connecting students to educational resources. And is also used in smart homes, industrial automation, healthcare monitoring, and smart cities to collect data, automate processes, and improve efficiency.

Examples:

Smartboards, connected sensors in classrooms, remote learning tools.
Smart thermostats like Nest, wearable health devices like Fitbit, industrial IoT platforms like GE’s Predix.

5. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality

VR and AR are designed to create immersive and interactive environments. VR provides a fully immersive experience, while AR overlays digital information onto the real world.


VR and AR are used for virtual labs, field trips, medical training simulations, and interactive history lessons. They enhance engagement and provide practical experience in a controlled environment for education. while in IT industry, it is used in gaming, product design, virtual meetings, real estate virtual tours, and training simulations for various industries.

Examples:

Google Expeditions (VR field trips), zSpace (AR-enabled learning experiences).
Oculus Rift (VR headset), Microsoft HoloLens (AR device), IKEA Place (AR app for visualizing furniture).
